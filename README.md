Coding Challenge for [Receiptful](https://receiptful.com/).

In answering the code questions, please submit code as if you intended to ship it to production. The details matter. Tests are expected, as is well written, simple idiomatic code.

We’d recommend you use whatever language you feel strongest in. It doesn’t have to be one we use — we believe good engineers can be productive in any language. Other applicants have found gist.github.com useful for sharing solutions.

We believe this should take less than a hour to complete, but understand you may have other commitments and time constraints. 

Write some code, that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers. e.g. `[[1,2,[3]],4]` -> `[1,2,3,4]`.
